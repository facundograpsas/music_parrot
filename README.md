## About

Music Parrot is a music application made with the purpose of relative pitch training. 
The general idea is to learn to recognize and repeat melodies and the intervals within them in a fun way.


The reason of why I'm making it it's because even thought there's many ear training apps availables in the stores, practically all of them have a non-fun/non-musical approach.
And they don't have parrot sounds either!
